# Hello there!

I'm Jasmine, a graduating computer science + applied mathematics student at UC Santa Cruz and incoming computer science grad student at Georgia Tech. My interests span software development, systems development, and numerical modeling.

Currently, I am involved in research labs in the following areas:

- [Computational ecology](https://ecoscape-earth.github.io/), in which I maintain and update Python packages that support efficient predictive models for the study of bird species connectivity.
- [Social computing](https://tech4good.soe.ucsc.edu/), in which I lead teams in producing full-stack web applications and assist in user research for our various research projects.

In the past:

- I have done two internships at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), where I architected software systems that automated test procedures and configuration file generation for [Deep Space Network](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/dsn/) emulators.
- I have mentored participants in the Google Summer of Code who worked on [improving core infrastructure and experiences on Causeway](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2024/projects/wTxAXxEz), a web application that promotes experiential learning pathways based on a micro-role hierarchy.
