# Hello there!

I'm Jasmine, a graduating computer science + applied mathematics student at UC Santa Cruz and incoming computer science grad student at Georgia Tech. My interests span software development, systems development, and numerical modeling.

Currently, I am involved in research labs in the following areas:

- [Computational ecology](https://ecoscape-earth.github.io/), in which I maintain and update Python packages that support efficient predictive models for the study of bird species connectivity. Our lab group is interested in developing models and tools that aid ecologists in identifying key areas for conservation efforts; along with the said predictive model, this encompasses other initiatives such as an online browser for the model and improvements to our large-scale habitat generation process for bird species.
- [Social computing](https://tech4good.soe.ucsc.edu/), in which I lead teams in producing web applications and assist in user research for our various research projects. In the Tech4Good lab, I support student teams in learning web development with a stack that involves TypeScript, Angular, NgRx, RxJS, and Firebase, and I manage the lab of 100+ on a higher level by evaluating lab applicants and refining long-term project objectives.

In the past:

- I have done two internships at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), where I architected software systems that automated test procedures and configuration file generation for [Deep Space Network](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/dsn/) emulators. I also managed to explore some really cool space facilities in the process, including the Mars Yard and the Space Flight Operations Facility!
- I have mentored participants in the Google Summer of Code who worked on [improving core infrastructure and experiences on Causeway](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2024/projects/wTxAXxEz), a web application that promotes experiential learning pathways based on a micro-role hierarchy. I performed frequent check-ins with participants every week to discuss questions, points of confusion, and next steps, and I conducted thorough reviews for 30+ pull requests addressing new features and bugs.
